# Learning-Route-for-Digital-IC-Design
1.About This Repository

This repository documents my learning progress in Digital IC Design, with the goal of building a solid and structured foundation toward industry-oriented roles.

Many beginners — especially students from Communication Engineering or other electronics-related majors — are interested in circuit or IC design but often struggle due to the lack of clear learning guidance. I faced the same problem when I first started.
Therefore, I created and shared this repository to organize my own learning process, and to provide a reference for others who are on a similar path. I also hope it can serve as a place for mutual learning and encouragement.

2.Language Disclaimer

I am a native Chinese speaker, and my English grammar may not always be perfect.
This repository is written in English to make it accessible to a broader audience. Some parts of the text are translated with the help of AI, while others are written by myself.
If there are any unclear or inaccurate expressions, your understanding is appreciated.

3.Notes on the Learning Roadmap

The roadmap recorded in this repository roughly progresses from digital circuit design, to FPGA practice, and then toward SoC and ASIC design.
It should be treated as a reference rather than a strict standard. Specific learning paths may vary depending on target positions and individual needs.
